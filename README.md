## Item Battle!
In a fight between a fish and a water bottle, who would win?

In this pixel art game, the player can input pictures of objects in the real world. These items are then assigned unique stats (health, speed, and strength) based on whatever is in the image and converted into pixelated characters. Afterward, the player can embody one item and battle against the other in several round-based battles to determine, once and for all, which item is truly superior!

The game highlights the duality of the real world and the virtual worldâ€”particularly, the intersection between the two. Using AI, this game can process and reconstruct items from images taken by the user, bridging the gap between the two worlds to create a fun and engaging experience.
